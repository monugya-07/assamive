                        The Owner : Bhaskar Bora :
                        "Welcome to ASSAMIVE, a place where passion meets purpose. Founded on a deep-rooted love for tea
                        and a commitment to sustainability, we take pride in cultivating our own tea on lush,
                        family-owned farms. Our journey began with a vision to share the purity of nature through
                        exceptional tea blends, and today, that vision has blossomed into a brand that stands for
                        quality, authenticity, and a profound connection to the earth.

                        At ASSAMIVE, we believe in more than just providing tea; we aim to deliver an experience that
                        transcends the ordinary. Each leaf is carefully nurtured under the sun, handpicked, and expertly
                        blended to bring you a symphony of flavors in every cup. We take joy in offering our own
                        signature blends, alongside a thoughtfully curated selection of products from trusted partners
                        like Decathlon and Trekmonk.

                        Beyond the products, ASSAMIVE is a community of tea enthusiasts, adventurers, and individuals
                        who appreciate the finer things in life. We invite you to join us on this journey of discovery,
                        where the richness of our teas and the quality of our offerings reflect our unwavering
                        commitment to your satisfaction.

                        Thank you for being a part of the ASSAMIVE family. Sip, explore, and savor the essence of life
                        with us."
